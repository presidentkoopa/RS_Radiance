// GlowInTheDark 2.0 -- the engine.
//
// Replaces the 1.1 ACS script entirely. What changed and why:
//
//   1.1 walked sector TAGS 0..99998 calling ACS SetSectorGlow. Tag 0 matches
//   every UNTAGGED sector at once (FSectorTagIterator::Next, p_tags.cpp), and
//   random() is evaluated once per call, so the whole map received a single
//   shared colour -- the per-sector randomisation it advertised never
//   happened. Everything after tag 0 hit only doors and lifts, arriving one
//   per tic over ~47 minutes because its throttle test was inverted.
//
//   This iterates Level.Sectors by index. Every sector is reached, each gets
//   its own colour, and the whole map is done in a handful of tics.
//
// Lane enable/disable is carried by COLOUR ALPHA and height, not by a separate
// flag. Flat glow is gated on `FlatGlowColor.a > 0 && FlatGlowHeight > 0`
// (HWFlat::DrawFlat, hw_flats.cpp): alpha 0 is off. Wall glow is read by
// sector_t::GetWallGlow (p_sectors.cpp), where a colour of exactly 0 hands the
// wall back to its texture's own GLDEFS glow -- which is what a lane switched
// off writes, with a height of 0 beside it. This is why GITD_Util always
// builds colours with alpha 255 -- a colour that loses its alpha silently
// kills a flat lane with no error anywhere.

// One lane's settings, read once per apply rather than per sector.
