// RS_Flashlight -- a torch that lights the air.
//
// The engine draws it: volumetricbeam.fp, a raymarched cone in view space, so
// each eye resolves its own matrix and stereo comes out right without the
// shader knowing VR exists. What this mod owns is whether it is on, where it is
// mounted, and what it looks like.
//
// IT TAKES SLOT 1 OF THIRTY-TWO. Slot 0 is where every caller that never passes
// a slot lands -- the weapon wheel's laser and the Lance still do -- so a torch
// on slot 0 fought them: whichever published last won, and the torch-off path
// erased their cone every tic. RS_VR_PistolTest's muzzle flashes sit at
// wm_flash_slot (4) + hand. The fog glow follows the lowest live slot, so the
// torch keeps it except while something on slot 0 is lit.
//
// PUBLISHED FROM UiTick, NOT WorldTick. The playsim freezes while a menu is
// open, so a beam published from WorldTick could not show a slider's change
// until the menu closed. The beam setters are clearscope for exactly this, and
// UiTick runs every tic whether or not a menu is up. The POSE is not ours at
// all: SetVolumetricBeamAnchor has the renderer read the hand or head every
// frame, so a hand torch does not step at 35 Hz behind a 90 Hz controller.
//
// THE SWITCH IS AN INVENTORY TOKEN, NOT A CVAR.
//
// A cvar lives on one machine. A token is playsim state: it is synchronised
// like anything else an actor carries and it saves with the game, so the whole
// game agrees whether your torch is on. Drawing it is another matter -- only
// the console player's own torch is published here, because the anchor reads
// the console player's pose.
//
// THE SPOT ON THE WALL IS A REAL DYNAMIC LIGHT, AND IT IS PLAYSIM STATE.
//
// The cone lights air; nothing in volumetricbeam.fp touches a wall, a floor or
// a monster. The spot is an attached SPOT light on the player pawn itself, so
// every client puts every player's spot on that player's pawn and the engine
// holds it in that player's own hand (SetAttachedLightAnchor reads the pawn's
// player). It is built from the PLAYER'S USERINFO, not the local cvars, so all
// machines draw your spot in your colour -- a local read would paint everyone
// else's torch in mine.
//
// A_AttachLight IS PLAY SCOPE, SO IT CANNOT RIDE THE UiTick PUBLISH. The beam
// setters are declared clearscope; the Actor light natives are not, and the
// compiler's scope barrier (scopebarrier.cpp AddFlags) refuses a ui or
// clearscope caller reaching a play method. So the spot is applied from play:
// WorldTick normally, and NetworkProcess while a menu has the playsim stopped.
// That still moves live: G_Ticker runs net commands every tic paused or not,
// and P_Ticker's paused branch rebuilds any lights flagged for it before the
// frame is drawn. The pose never waits on either -- the renderer re-poses
// anchored lights every frame.
